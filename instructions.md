Personal notes:

DEBUG: 
P to freeze time ticks
T to advance time
Q to be able to talk to ALL npcs again

**Starting scene name is ActualDarkScene, game day should start at 1** 

Start the NumSecondsAwake at 12.75*3600 aka 45900, found that to be a decent number since Day 1 you cant leave the house and there's not much to do so we don't want player to wait forever. (50400 is the number btw that u need to sleep
)
