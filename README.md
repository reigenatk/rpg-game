# rpg-game
A 2D top-down RPG game I am making in Unity. It's going to be mostly dialogue/story driven. Name still undecided. The end plan is to release it on itch.io, maybe even on Steam if I feel it's good enough. I wanna try to do my best job here though, so I'm going to set no deadlines.

I've actually been working on this since around September 2021, but school got in the way, and also lack of motivation (as always). I only now remembered that GitHub exists, which is why the commit is a bit late

# Motivation
My favorite kinds of games are probably indie RPG games, so I decided to give a shot at making one. I've always been amazed at how much one developer can do. I find that some of my favorite games were developed by one person (or a team of small people). Games like LISA, Undertale, OneShot, OMORI, Stardew Valley, (and recently, I played Katana Zero which was insanely good).

# Technologies
This is made in Unity, though I did consider using GameMaker Studio or Godot (and even RPGMaker).
But ultimately, I decided to stick to what I'm familiar with. 
This is still in very rough development, I'd say it's like 20% done right now, and I don't even know if I'll have the actual ability to finish it. I really want to, 
but sometimes motivation is getting at me. I've got a ton of stuff to learn, specifically how to not make my pixel art look terrible.

# Synopsis
More or less a game about being a depressed college student. You'll never guess where I got the inspiration for that from ðŸ˜‰
