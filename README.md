# rpg-game
A 2D top-down RPG game I am making in Unity. Name still undecided. The end plan is to release it on itch.io, maybe even on Steam if I feel it's good enough.

I've actually been working on this since early 2021, but school got in the way, and lack of motivation also got in the way.

# Motivation
My favorite kinds of games are probably indie RPG games, so I decided to give a shot at making one. I've always been amazed at how much one developer can do. I find that some of my favorite games were developed by one person (or a team of small people). Games like LISA, Undertale, OneShot, OMORI, Stardew Valley, (and recently, I played Katana Zero which was insanely good).

# Technologies
This is made in Unity, 
though I did consider using GameMaker Studio or Godot.
But ultimately, I decided to stick to what I'm familiar with. 
This is still in very rough development, I'd say it's like 20% done right now, and I don't even know if I'll finish it. I really want to, 
but sometimes motivation is getting at me.

# Synopsis
More or less a game about being a depressed college student. You'll never guess where I got the inspiration for that from ðŸ˜‰
