Kind of like a funny RPG game. This will be like a depression simulator of sorts.

So you have three categories, loneliness, entertained, contentedness, and energy. They all start at 100, and over time, if you do nothing, they will all go down. contentedness is like the feeling of having accomplished something meaningful (basic stuff like showering eating, taking care of yourself, but also the feeling that you're accomplishing things), but entertained is like incel happiness (watching anime, jerking off, doing no-life activities).

Everything but incel activities will reduce energy. As for loneliness, goes down if you see normies, goes up if you meet people.

The goal is to not let any of them get low. If they hit zero, the game ends. All of them ends with the player killing himself. Maybe different cutscenes for each kind of death.

Activity ideas:

- Showering: +contentedness, -Energy
- Talking to Kabowski: +Loneliness -Energy (depending on who) -Entertained
- Talking to Brain: +Loneliness -Energy +Entertained -contentedness (get mogged by big brain)
- Browse the internet/Video Games: +Entertained -contentedness (if done more than once) 
- Jerking Off: +Entertained -contentedness -Energy
- Call from mom/Run into person who knows you: +Loneliness -Entertained -contentedness -Energy
- Attend Lecture: +contentedness, +/-Entertained (depending on what lecture) -Energy
- Go to club: +Loneliness +/-Entertained (depending on what club. Can also have club-by-club scenarios, some are mean, others are nice) -Energy
- Sleep: +Energy
- Eat: +Energy +Loneliness (lmao) +Contentedness
- Take a crap: +Contentedness
- Watch Anime: +Loneliness +Entertained -Contentedness
- Ask out a girl: If yes, add to all. If no, deduct from all.
- Touch Grass (go outside to take a walk) +Contentedness
- Stay up late: +Entertained, -Energy for the next day
- Drink alcohol: +Entertained - Energy for next day, -Loneliness if done with ppl

Cutscene ideas:
- See a couple holding hands: +Loneliness
- Kabowski having loud ass sex in other room: -Energy +Loneliness +Entertained
- Brain gets drunk on his own 100% alcohol: +Entertained -Loneliness 
- Go to a party: +Entertained +/-Loneliness 
- When he first tries to go to the grocery store, awkward to talk to real ppl -everything to discourage the player lol
